# Design Open hardware fast high resolution laser

The laser module is designed in FreeCAD so it can be edited by anyone.
Most of the components can be laser cut to facilitate mass production.
Non-flat components should be printed on a fused filament fabrication printer.

# Notes
FreeCAD files contains the designs

Deprecated folder contains the old design files of the Hexastorm. These are no longer in use

The laser can be aligned but the laser mount has four screws with springs. This is too much.
Three spots can be seen. A spot created by refraction through the prism. A spot by going partly over the prism. A spot by reflection on the copper reference substrate of the prism.
By changing the height and angle of the laser a user can alter the balance between these spots.
