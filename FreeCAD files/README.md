## Technical Note
A laser bundle which is refracted by a prism follows three paths. 
A spot created by refraction through the prism. A spot by going partly over the prism.
A spot by reflection on the copper reference substrate of the prism.  
By changing the height and angle of the laser a user can alter the balance between these spots.
To filter out the reflection a slit is added in the front plate.

### First Cylindrical lens
The first cylindrical lens has a focal length of 75 mm. The lens used is [#48-355](https://www.edmundoptics.com/p/125mm-dia-x-75mm-fl-mgfsub2sub-coated-cylinder-lens/8603/). 

### Second Cylindrical lens
The second cylindrical lens has a focal length of 25 mm. The lens used is [#48-353](https://www.edmundoptics.com/p/125mm-dia-x-25mm-fl-mgfsub2sub-coated-cylinder-lens/8601/).
The mirror used is 10x10x2 mm, e.g. [#45-517](https://www.edmundoptics.com/p/10-x-10mm-enhanced-aluminum-4-6lambda-mirror/6013/).
