### Laser height
The laser should be at a height of 29 mm.

### Felix_mount
Used to mount the laser module to the Felix printers frame. 

### Laser tube _support
Should be printed twice, to clamp the laser module.

### Second Cylindrical lens
The second cylindrical lens has a focal length of 25 mm. The lens used is [#48-353](https://www.edmundoptics.com/p/125mm-dia-x-25mm-fl-mgfsub2sub-coated-cylinder-lens/8601/).
The mirror used is 10x10x2 mm, e.g. [#45-517](https://www.edmundoptics.com/p/10-x-10mm-enhanced-aluminum-4-6lambda-mirror/6013/).

### First Cylindrical lens
The first cylindrical lens has a focal length of 75 mm. The lens used is [#48-355](https://www.edmundoptics.com/p/125mm-dia-x-75mm-fl-mgfsub2sub-coated-cylinder-lens/8603/).
The insert used is Jeveka TAPPEX [M2x4](https://www.jeveka.com/nl/catalog/inserts-kato-spirol-ensat-tappex-magneten-magna/tappex-inserts-voor-kunststof/tappex-multisert-inserts-tapxmsm0/tapxmsm00020000/groups/g+c+a+nr+view). 

### Laser Housing
The spring selected is [C0180-024-0310M](https://www.asraymond.com/catalog/C01800240310M).
The documentd load length is 4.8 mm and the free length is 7.8 mm and the spring constant is 5 N/mm (32.6lb/in). 

### ATX (power supply)
Mounted to optical plate with 25 mm pitch and M6 holes. Screw used to mount holders to ATX is M3x5.

### Beaglebone fixture
Used to mount Beaglebone to optical plate with 25 mm pitch and M6 holes.

### Optical plate
Thorlabs MB3045/M, aluminum breadboard, 300 mm x 450 mm x 12.7 mm with M6 taps.
4x M6x25 screws to fix scanhead to optical plate
3x M6x12 screws to fix atx to optical plate
2x M6x12 screws to fix beaglebone to optical plate

### Box folder
Used to create the cuts in the box with the FreeCAD LCinterlocking module.

## TODO
- component list is incomplete (springs for laser mount are missing)

## Notes 
#### Spring suppliers
In the Netherlands, one could consider [Alcomex](https://www.alcomex.com) and [Tevema](https://ww.tevema.com).
Use the silicon glue to fix the glasses (CAF3).
